# Learn Git

## Git Commands

1. ``` git status```
Show the working tree status.We will use this command to show the changes in local repo.When use this we will see the branch name on which we are working.

2. To make a new branch other than master. Use
``` git branch branch-name ```

> A branch is kind of like a fork on your computer. When you have your own branch, itâ€™s a place where you can make changes without affecting `master`.

3. ``` git add path-to-your-file ``` will allow you to pre-select the files you want to save. Add the files one at a time.

4. ```git commit -m"commit message" ``` will group your changes together into a commit. The message should be short, describe the work that you did, and include the issue number that you are working on.

5. ```git push origin name-of-branch ``` to save your commit.
